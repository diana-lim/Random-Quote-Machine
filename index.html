User Story #7: On first load, my quote machine displays the random quote's author in the element with id="author".

User Story #8: When the #new-quote button is clicked, my quote machine should fetch a new quote and display it in the #text element.

User Story #9: My quote machine should fetch the new quote's author when the #new-quote button is clicked and display it in the #author element.

User Story #10: I can tweet the current quote by clicking on the #tweet-quotea element. This a element should include the "twitter.com/intent/tweet" path in its href attribute to tweet the current quote.

User Story #11: The #quote-box wrapper element should be horizontally centered. Please run tests with browser's zoom level at 100% and page maximized.
